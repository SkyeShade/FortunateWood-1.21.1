# Fortunate Wood

**Fortunate Wood** is a [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net/) mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 that makes **Fortune on axes** work for logs — *but only for naturally generated logs*.  
This means you can get more wood from real trees, but tree farms made from player-placed logs won’t give you extra drops.

## Features

- **Fortune on axes now affects logs** (e.g., Fortune III can yield +0..3 logs by default).
- Works on **all logs** in the `#minecraft:logs` tag — including modded logs.
- **Only applies to natural logs**:
  - Logs you place yourself are tracked and won’t give extra drops.
  - Natural trees, shipwrecks, etc. are unaffected by the tracking.
